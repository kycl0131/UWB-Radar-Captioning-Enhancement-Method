Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224 were not used when initializing ViTModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ViTModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ViTModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ViTModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224 and are newly initialized: ['vit.pooler.dense.weight', 'vit.pooler.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
